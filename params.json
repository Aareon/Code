  "body": "# Code the flexible Python IRC Bot\r\n\r\nCode is a open source python IRC bot. Code can run on any operating system that supports Python 2.7, but works best on Linux based distrobutions.\r\n\r\nFeel free to test Code here: http://byteirc.org/channel/L\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nCode is packed full of features ranging from raw IRC functions to modules that can be unloaded and loaded with ease. Some features include:\r\n\r\n#### Control panel\r\nCode has a built-in control panel that you can enable, that also serves as a webserver and a REST api that allows you to remotely execute functions or retrieve information from the bot, all via GET/POST requests. Everything authenticated too!\r\n\r\n#### The control panel itself:\r\n![The control panel](https://i.imgur.com/ewAgVNu.png)\r\n\r\nWebserver authentication:\r\n![Control panel authentication](https://i.imgur.com/w5kbij3.png)\r\n\r\nMute feature (also shutdown, reboot, etc):\r\n![Control panel muting](https://i.imgur.com/BAkdmw0.png)\r\n\r\n#### Fast & lightweight\r\nCode is very small, so even with the extensive amount of features it has, it should run as little as possible.\r\n\r\n#### Modules\r\nCode uses modules for all of its commands and features. These modules can be loaded, unload, completely removed, and dynamically updated to fit the channels needs. Modules can be made easily, and because of the nature of the modules, you can make whatever you want/control the bot easily.\r\n\r\n#### Very user friendly\r\nIt is very easy to install and run Code, even if you have no knowledge of ever running a IRC bot before. I created the bot so it has either no external modules, or the modules are packaged with it. Help commands also help you with specific documentation for almost every command. Try `.help <command>`\r\n\r\n#### Easy to use API\r\nWhen creating your own modules, it is always very easy to have a documented API and easy to understand functions. Note, the API isn't fully documented, so there are a lot of features that aren't listed there. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code/wiki) for more information.\r\n\r\n#### Open-Source\r\nFound a bug, feature, or need technical support/advice? You can always navigate to the [Github](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code/issues) page to make requests and post bugs. Heck, even fork Code and make your own modifications!\r\n\r\n#### Configuration\r\nAlmost ever single aspect of the bot is configurable to your likings. Don't like a module? Remove it. Like only ONE module? Whitelist it!\r\n\r\n## Installation - How do I install? \r\n\r\n**If you have any issues during the install, feel free to head to http://chat.liamstanley.io/ to get help**\r\n\r\nUnix & Unix-like OS: \r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n    apt-get install python2.7 git screen\r\n    git clone https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code.git\r\n    cp -rf example.json config.json\r\n    nano config.json\r\n    python code.py\r\n\r\nIf you wish to not run your bot in the foreground, you may use the `screen` daemon as so:\r\n\r\n    screen -S code python code.py\r\n\r\nThis creates a terminal window that can be logged into and out without disturbing the process in that window. To exit screen safely, hit `CTRL+A` then `CTRL+D`.\r\nTo log back into, and view the playback of Code, type `screen -x code`.\r\n\r\nWindows: \r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n- Make sure you have Python installed `http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/`\r\n- Download Code here: `https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code/zipball/master` and unzip it.\r\n- Copy and rename `example.json` to `config.json` (Note, it's best NOT to use the Windows notepad, rather, use Notepad++)\r\n- You can open up command prompt, `cd` to Codes directory, and execute Code with `python code.py`.\r\n- Note, if command prompt says that `python` is not a internal or external command/program, that means Python failed to be added to your system-wide %PATH% file. So, you need to add it to the %PATH% variable.\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n---------\r\n_________\r\n\r\nCode Copyright (C) 2012-2016 Liam Stanley\r\n    `Eiffel Forum License, version 2`\r\n    \r\n    1.
